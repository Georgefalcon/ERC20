## ERC20 TOKEN
An ERC-20 token is a type of cryptocurrency token standard on the Ethereum blockchain. ERC stands for Ethereum Request for Comment, and 20 is the number that was assigned to this standard.

ERC-20 tokens are fungible;
 meaning that each token is identical and interchangeable with every other token of the same type. This standard defines a set of rules and functions that must be followed in order for a token to be considered ERC-20 compliant. These rules include methods for transferring tokens, getting token balances, and other standard functionalities.

The ERC-20 standard has become the most widely used token standard on the Ethereum blockchain, with thousands of tokens adhering to its specifications. This standardization has facilitated the creation and adoption of various tokens for a wide range of purposes, including cryptocurrencies, utility tokens, and tokens representing assets such as real estate or commodities.
//AN INTERESTING DIGEST
Imagine you have a special kind of digital token that you want to use on the Ethereum blockchain. Now, this token needs to follow certain rules so that everyone knows how to use it. Think of these rules like a recipe for baking a cake - if you follow the recipe, you get a tasty cake.

The ERC-20 standard is like that recipe for tokens on Ethereum. It tells developers exactly how to make their tokens so they work smoothly with other Ethereum-based apps and wallets. These tokens can represent anything - from digital currencies to virtual goods or even shares in a company.

So, when you hear about an ERC-20 token, just think of it as a type of digital token that's made following a specific set of rules. And because these tokens follow the same rules, they can be easily traded, stored, and used in various Ethereum-based applications without any hiccups.

## METHODS

Sure, an ERC-20 token typically includes the following methods:

Name: This method returns the name of the Token.

Symbol: This method returns the symbol of the Token.

totalSupply: This method returns the total supply of the token.

balanceOf: This method allows you to check the balance of a specific Ethereum address.

transfer: This method is used to transfer tokens from the sender's address to another Ethereum address.

transferFrom: This method is similar to transfer but is used when tokens are being sent on behalf of another address, typically after approval.

approve: This method allows an address to approve another address to spend a certain amount of tokens on its behalf.

allowance: This method checks the amount of tokens that an approved address is allowed to spend on behalf of another address.

These methods make it possible for ERC-20 tokens to be transferred, managed, and interacted with by users and smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. Developers can build applications around these methods to create various functionalities such as wallets, exchanges, and decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols.
